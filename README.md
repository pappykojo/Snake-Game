# Text-Based Snake Game with 5 Levels of Difficulty


This is a simple text-based Snake game implemented in Python. The game allows the player to control a snake using the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys, and the objective is to eat the food (*) while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the Python file (`snake_game.py`) to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `snake_game.py` file is located.

3. Run the game using Python:

   ```
   python snake_game.py
   ```

4. Choose your level of difficulty:
   - 1: Easy
   - 2: Medium
   - 3: Hard
   - 4: Expert
   - 5: Insane

5. Use the following keys to control the snake's movement:
   - `w`: Move Up
   - `a`: Move Left
   - `s`: Move Down
   - `d`: Move Right

6. Try to eat the food (*) to grow the snake's length while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

7. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or hits the wall.

8. To exit the game, press `Ctrl + C`.

## Levels of Difficulty

- Easy: Slowest snake movement.
- Medium: Slightly faster than Easy.
- Hard: Moderate speed.
- Expert: Faster snake movement.
- Insane: The fastest and most challenging level.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Note

This is a basic text-based implementation of the Snake game. You can further enhance it by adding graphical interfaces, sound effects, or additional features.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
